### Project Objective

The goal of this project was to dive deep into TikTok user engagement. I wanted to find out what makes content go viral and how users interact with videos, with the aim of giving practical advice for boosting engagement and keeping users hooked.

### Project Description

This project involved a thorough analysis of TikTok user data to spot trends and understand how people engage with content. Here's a breakdown of what I did at each stage:

### Stages of the Project

1. **Data Collection**
   - I gathered data from TikTok using APIs and web scraping.
   - The dataset included user details, video features, engagement stats like likes and comments, and timing information.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - I cleaned the data to deal with any missing or inconsistent entries.
   - I also created new features that might affect engagement, such as video length, use of hashtags, and posting times.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - I explored the data to see how it was distributed and how different variables related to each other.
   - I used visual tools like histograms and scatter plots to identify patterns.
   - Key insights included the best times to post, popular hashtags, and trends among different user groups.

4. **Modeling and Prediction**
   - I built machine learning models to predict how well videos would engage users based on the data.
   - I tested several models like linear regression and decision trees to find the best one.
   - The best model was chosen based on its accuracy and reliability.

5. **Results and Insights**
   - The modeling results helped me give practical tips to TikTok content creators.
   - I suggested the best times to post, how to use hashtags effectively, and what kind of content gets the most engagement.
   - I also identified user groups that are more likely to engage with content, helping creators target their audience better.

6. **Conclusion**
   - I wrapped up the project with a summary of my findings and their impact on TikTok content strategies.
   - I also suggested keeping an eye on engagement metrics and adjusting strategies as new trends emerge.
